# Ethical-Hacking-Journal
A journal for  from CSIA 225

Ethical Hacking Challenge: Hack the Password of a zip file. 
I used Kali Linux and fcrackzip, zippasswordcrackerprov1.4f, and John the Ripper 
within Kali to disclose the content of the ZIP archive without having 
the password available. 
The journal contains pictures of my work with appropriate annotation
with the content of the zip file and a short summary how I solved the challenge.
